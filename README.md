### Minesweeper
````
Write an AI to play Minesweeper.

Minesweeper is a puzzle game that consists of a grid of cells, where some of the cells contain hidden “mines.”
Clicking on a cell that contains a mine detonates the mine, and causes the user to lose the game. 
Clicking on a “safe” cell (i.e., a cell that does not contain a mine) reveals a number that indicates how many 
neighboring cells – where a neighbor is a cell that is one square to the left, right, up, down, 
or diagonal from the given cell – contain a mine.

In this 3x3 Minesweeper game, for example, the three 1 values indicate that each of those cells has one neighboring cell that is a mine. 
The four 0 values indicate that each of those cells has no neighboring mine.
